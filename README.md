### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Experienced iOS Developer. Developed applications for Entertainment, e-commerce, Corporate businesses and other Domains.

## EasyGifts  E-Commerce App (Completely Developed by Me!)
I developed this app completely. This app was a Saudi Arabian clientâ€™s project whose one app was already running, they changed UI/UX of this new app. The idea was to send gifts to your loved ones by staying at your home. Gifts involve cents, bags, cake, watches, hats etc for the events like. birthday, marriage or other small events. One can send in different countries and can pay in small instalments using Tamara Payment Methods. We provided support in two languages English and Arabic at runtime from within the app.

Note: I have developed clone app for same company, but Screenshots are of original App.

## Karwan e Najia - Organisational App (Completely Developed by Me!)
[`ðŸ“² Available on the App Store`](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/karwan-e-najia/id1632663020)

I developed this app completely as well as wrote some APIs. I asked Dailymotion support to create URL Scheme, because they had not already created this feature, So now, I can open Organisationâ€™â€™s Dailymotion account on their app from my app. This app is for a non-profit organisation that spreads useful content in form of books, videos, news and quote pictures. I implemented Google page like search in books manually without using any library. Reduced size of app by putting books in text file and dealt with design and rendering manually. Embedded twitter timeline in Web View because, twitter SDK is deprecated in iOS latest versions. Managed User profile using firebase. Developed Qibla direction utility, Books reading, bookmarking, sharing topic wise, long text scrolling, highlighting searches text from all books. Playing videos, multiple downloading with pause/resume and network failure handling. Showing Dynamic sized ratio images as received from backend, rendering html news and handling hyperlink. Wrote APIs and placed them on server via cPanel.
